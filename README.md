# Neuronal-Network

This project contains several mini-projects that demonstrate various neural network techniques and algorithms.

## Folders and Description

### Flappy_Bird_QLearning
- A project for Q-Learning applied to the Flappy Bird game.
- Includes resources on On-Policy and Off-Policy methods, CNN, and the Actor-Critic algorithm.
- The CNN architecture and hyperparameters used in the training process are detailed in this folder's README.
- With pytorch.
### MNIST-Perceptron
- The simplest neural network using perceptrons, without hidden layers, with approximately 10 perceptrons.
- This network returns the digit from the MNIST dataset.
- Maded from Scratch without frameworks.

### MNIST_Multiple_Layers
- A neural network with multiple layers, including 1 hidden layer of 100 neurons.
- Implemented from scratch without using PyTorch.

### MNIST_in_Pytorch (Fully Connected Layers)
- Similar to the previous network but implemented with PyTorch.
- Includes 2 hidden layers.
